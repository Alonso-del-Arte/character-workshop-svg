# Character Workshop

This is for me to experiment with characters that are not already in Unicode by 
taking existing characters and transforming them. If I eventually propose these 
characters to Unicode, I may or may not use the techniques in this repository to 
form up the reference glyphs for Unicode.

I take an existing character, put it into Inkscape &mdash; an editor for 
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files &mdash; convert the character to a path, 
add nodes, then edit the nodes to deform the character to the desired shape, 
almost always distorting the character's semantic meaning.

Because of that distortion of semantic meaning, one should not do this sort of 
thing for characters that are already in Unicode.

This repository will *not* be open to Hacktoberfest.
