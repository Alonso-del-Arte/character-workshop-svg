# Character Workshop

This is for me to experiment with characters that are not already in Unicode by 
taking existing characters and transforming them. If I eventually propose these 
characters to Unicode, I may or may not use the techniques in this repository to 
form up the reference glyphs for Unicode.

This repository will *not* be open to Hacktoberfest.
